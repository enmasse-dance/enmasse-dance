  <p>En Masse is a two night camping festival curated by Batu. The artists entrusted with your musical trip will only be revealed in part and much closer to the time. We hope to create and sustain a small but committed community of dancers & like-minded souls who revel in stepping into the sonic unknown.  </p>

<p>Our home, a 140 acre permaculture farm in the foothills of the Black Mountains, will be transformed into an immersive otherworld with three carefully curated & expertly produced dancefloors. The diverse and bold programming will move between each stage in turn, unifying En Masse as we explore each part of this beautiful & environmentally sustainable site together, with a mutual respect for each other and our surroundings.   </p>

<p>En Masse advance tickets are available now. The site comes fully equipped with toilet and shower facilities, as well as sheltered dance floors with a late licence for maximal merriment until dawn. You can also sign up to our newsletter for updates & information about : bell tent availability, coach tickets from Bristol, our delicious food vendors, artistic installations, musical direction, “What is permaculture?” and more.  </p>

<p>Friends old, new & soon to be, thank you for trusting us with your hard earned weekend. We look forward to welcoming you En Masse and encourage you to take the Friday off so you can pitch and relax ahead of our maiden musical voyage together. See you on the 12th June 2020!   </p>
